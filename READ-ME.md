This is a school project about creating a place comparison website with;
storing and adding places (MongoDB),
adding comments and point for each place with the exact date it was added,
giving detailed informations, tags, total average points(according to given comments) for each place,
showing exact locations on Google Maps,
showing closest places to given coordinates.

by me.

you can give it a try from here:
